# Markdown Syntax

This file demonstrates some basic markdown syntax.

## Markdown

Markdown is a filetype that allows you to write titles, sections, lists, and more features!

You can _italicize_ text by wrapping it in single asterisks (\*).

You can **bold** text by wrapping it in double asterisks (\*\*).

# You can make a Heading 1 by putting a single hashtag (#) at the start of the line

## Or a Heading 2 (which is slightly smaller) with double hashtags (##)

- This is an unordered list.
- Each list item has a single asterisk at the start of the line.

1. This is an ordered list.
2. Each list item has a consecutive number at the start of the line.

Here's a [link](https://benjaminjohnson2204.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/) to the Github pages for my site. You can create a link by putting the text in [brackets] followed by the link's URL in (parentheses).

You can insert an image ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ogw/AOh-ky2oP2BRS3cEghGOB9SnymfUB7GSu_GxqbbiErN6Jg=s32-c-mo) with an exclamation point ! followed by [brackets] and the image url in (parentheses).

> You can write a quote by putting > at the start of the line.

You can create a horizontal line:

---

with a blank line followed by three hyphens (-).

You can write code `inline` by surrounding it with single backticks (`) or write a

```
Code block
```

by surrounding it with three backticks (```).
